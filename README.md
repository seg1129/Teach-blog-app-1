# Teach-blog-app-1
This repo will be used to teach students how to create their first web application. We will be building a blog app using Django web framework

# Initial Local Environment setup
We will be using a python web framework called Django for this excersice of building a simple blog web application. To get your local environment set up you will need to have 
- Python 3.10, 3.11 or 3.12,
- a python virtual Enviroment and
- Django version 5.0.

If you already have python and a python virtual environment set up, go ahead and skip to 'Downloading Django' to prepare for this session. 

## Installing Python
There are many different ways to install python, here I will give two resources that I find helpful. 
### Install a single version of Python
If you think you will not use multiple versions of python then you can go directly to [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads) and download version 3.10, 3.11 or 3.12.
### Managing multiple versions of Python
I use pyenv to manage multiple different versions of python on my machine, it also works well with common python virtual enviroment tools. Follow the resouces below to get pyenv set up on your machine.
- [these steps for mac](https://realpython.com/intro-to-pyenv/) 
- [these steps for windows](https://pypi.org/project/pyenv-win/)

## Using a Python Virtual Enviroment
Using a python virtual enviroment allows you to have multple python projects on your machine at once without having different versions of python or libraries conflict with eachother. I highly recommend using virtual enviorment to manage all of your python projects. You can read [here](https://realpython.com/python-virtual-environments-a-primer/#why-do-you-need-virtual-environments?) for more information about this. Here are some resources, you only need to select one of these tools to use:

**Mac Resources:**
- [pyenv virtual enviroment set up](https://realpython.com/intro-to-pyenv/#virtual-environments-and-pyenv)
- [Python's venv](https://realpython.com/python-virtual-environments-a-primer/)
- [virtualenv](https://realpython.com/python-virtual-environments-a-primer/#the-virtualenv-project)

**Windows Resources:**
- [Virtualenv](https://mothergeo-py.readthedocs.io/en/latest/development/how-to/venv-win.html)

  Note: I do not reccomend using conda due to all of the additional libraries it downloads.

## Downloading and setting up Django with Mac
1. Create a new python virtual enviornment using python version 3.10, 3.11 or 3.12 and give the env a unique name.
2. Install Django: `python -m pip install Django==5.0.3`
3. Verify your installation worked: `python -m django --version` output should be the version of Django you installed.
4. Navigate to the file system that you want to store you code for this project.
5. Create a Django project - This will auto-generate some code for your new project. `django-admin startproject firstWebApp`
6. Navigate into the project folder you juest created: `cd ./firstWebApp`
7. Create a Django app - This will also auto-generate some code for your new application. Before running, make sure you are in the same directory, in your project, as file 'manage.py'. `python manage.py startapp blog`
8. Run the development server `python manage.py runserver 8000`
9. Navigate to the web browser `localhost:8000` and you should see a blue Django ribbon with a log in page. This is an indication that your project is all set up and you are ready to go!

## Downloading and setting up Django with Windows
1. Create a new python virtual enviornment using python version 3.10, 3.11 or 3.12 and give the env a unique name.
2. Install Django: `py -m pip install Django==5.0.3`
3. Verify your installation worked: `py -m django --version` output should be the version of Django you installed.
4. Navigate to the file system that you want to store you code for this project.
5. Create a Django project - This will auto-generate some code for your new project. `py -m django startproject firstWebApp`
6. Navigate into the project folder you just created: 'cd .\firstWebApp`
7. Create a Django app - This will also auto-generate some code for your new application. Before running, make sure you are in the same directory, in your project, as file 'manage.py'. `py manage.py startapp blog`
8. Run the development server `py manage.py runserver 8000`
9. Navigate to the web browser `localhost:8000` and you should see a blue Django ribbon with a log in page. This is an indication that your project is all set up and you are ready to go!

## IDE
Using your prefered IDE, open the project folder 'firstWebApp'.
